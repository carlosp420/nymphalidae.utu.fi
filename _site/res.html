        <p>
        Welcome to the home page of the Nymphalidae Systematics Group 
        at the <a href='http://www.sci.utu.fi/biologia/genfys.html' target='_blank'>Laboratory of Genetics</a>,
        University of Turku. The group is headed by <a href='Wahlberg.htm'>Niklas Wahlberg</a>
        and our major goal is to contribute to the understanding of evolutionary processes that
        are involved in diversification of species. Our model group has for long been the family
        Nymphalidae, which has been of exceptional utility in developing both 
        <a href='Nymphalidae/Molecular.htm'>practical laboratory methods</a> as well as insights
        into the processes leading to diversification. Our results have shown that the butterflies
        are older than previously thought and that there have been several periods during the 
        history of the Earth that have strongly affected the diversification of Nymphalidae, such 
        as <a href='Wahlbergetal2009.pdf'>the Cretaceous-Paleogene mass extinction event</a> and 
        <a href='PenaWahlberg2008.pdf'>the drying up of the planet during the Oligocene</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
        These results, along with results suggesting that similar patterns are found in the other
        butterfly families, have prompted us to expand our studies to other families of Lepidoptera.
        In particular we have been working on the noctuoid complex of families and Geometridae, 
        but are also working in collaboration on other families. We have been able to utilize 
        <a href='Nymphalidae/Molecular.htm'>the primers</a> developed for Nymphalidae across all of
        Lepidoptera, which allows us to rapidly generate large datasets for analysis. We are also 
        currently developing new methods that take advantage of Next Generation Sequencing 
        technologies, that allow us to generate much larger datasets than earlier. We thus intend to
        test new and exciting hypotheses about the factors driving diversification in Lepidoptera,
        from the comparatively species poor nonditrysians to the large megadiverse families of Ditrysia.
        </p>

        <p>
        We continue to work on Nymphalidae, especially in collaboration with 
        other researchers focussing on particular subgroups within the family.
        Our <a href='Vouchers.htm'>database</a> now has multiple gene sequences 
        for about 2000 species of Nymphalidae (up to 11 gene regions per species),
        making it possible to study the details of diversification processes in 
        almost any taxon of the family. We are particularly interested in the 
        subfamily Satyrinae, as it is the most species-rich subfamily of Nymphalidae
        and shows intriguing patterns of diversification. It has also proven to be a
        challenging subfamily to study, with problems ranging from species 
        definitions to methodological problems associated with potential rapid radiations.
        </p>

        <p>
        The NSG uses mainly <a href='Nymphalidae/Molecular.htm'>molecular methods</a>
        in its work. In order to document our sources of DNA, we have a policy of putting
        up images of our voucher specimens (when available) on the internet. To access
        these images follow the <a href='Vouchers.htm'>Voucher database</a> link above.
        We also aim to link our voucher images with their respective DNA sequences on 
        public databases through 
        <a href='http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/linkout/index.html' target='_blank'>GenBank's LinkOut</a> service.
        </p> 
 
        <p>
        Our work is highly collaborative and we collaborate with many people around 
        the world. Our work is not restricted to Lepidoptera, we work also on other insect
        orders, viruses, plants, and even the evolutionary history of languages. We 
        continue to explore other systems that help us understand how evolution has shaped
        the world we live in.
