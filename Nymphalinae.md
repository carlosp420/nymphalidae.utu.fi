<h2 align="center">The subfamily NYMPHALINAE</h2>

<p>The circumscription of the subfamily Nymphalinae has changed many times over the past decades from encompassing about half of the ca. 6000 species of Nymphalidae to its current rather restricted sense of <a href="Nymphcheck.htm">about 495 species</a> (according to the latest version of the Classification of Nymphalidae). The species are placed into 6 tribes and 57 genera. The current tribes are Coeini, Nymphalini, Junoniini, Victorinini, Kallimini and Melitaeini, each of which is a well-supported, stable clade. In addition to the six tribes, there are several so-called "rogue" taxa (<i>Kallimoides, Vanessula, Rhinopalpa</i> and <i>Pycina</i>, all of which are monotypic), whose relationships are not entirely clear at the moment. </p>

<img src="Nymphalinae.jpg" width="300" alt="Nymphalinae" align="right" />
<p>We have studied the evolutionary history of the subfamily in detail, mainly based on DNA sequences from <a href="../Molecular.htm">three gene regions</a>. The <a href="http://www.tolweb.org/Nymphalinae" target="_blank">phylogenetic relationships</a> of the 57 genera suggest that there are 10 major lineages in the subfamily (see Wahlberg et al. 2005, Wahlberg 2006). The subfamily appears to have diverged from it's sister group (possibly <a href="../Cyrestinae/Cyrestinae.htm">Cyrestinae</a>) some 80 million years ago. The subfamily itself began diversifying after the catastrophic event that caused the mass extinction of e.g. the dinosaurs about 65 million years ago (the so-called K/T event). The first split was between the ancestors of the tribe Coeini and the rest of Nymphalinae, which appears to have happened soon after the K/T event. The timing of divergences in the rest of Nymphalinae has been studied in detail by Wahlberg (2006), and the <a href="timing.htm">results</a> show that the deeper divergences in this group happened at the end of the Paleocene/beginning of the Eocene.</p>

<h3><a href="http://www.tolweb.org/Coeini" target="_blank">Coeini</a></h3>
<p>The tribe Coeini appears to contain only two genera: <i>Historis</i> and <i>Baeotus</i>. Historically the genera <i>Colobura, Tigridia, Smyrna</i> and <i>Pycina</i> have been associated with this tribe, but the former three are clearly within Nymphalini. <i>Pycina</i> has not been included in any published study, but recent unpublished molecular data generated by us is showing that the genus is a so-called "long-branch taxon" and it's position is not stable or well-supported in any analysis. Interestingly, <i>Pycina</i> appears to be sister to <i>Rhinopalpa</i>, another long-branch taxon. The four species of <i>Baeotus</i> form a well-supported, stable monophyletic group, whereas the two species of <i>Historis</i> do not. There may yet be cause to resurrect the genus <i>Coea</i> for the species <i>acheronta</i> if this turns out to be the sister group to <i>Baeotus</i> with more data. For the present, we prefer to retain it in the genus <i>Historis</i>. The tribe Coeini is entirely restricted to the New World, and the six species are mainly found in the tropical rainforests of South America. The position of the tribe as the sister group to the rest of Nymphalinae is being confirmed by a large dataset of sequences from 10 genes. Timings of divergences have not been studied for this group yet.</p>

<h3><a href="http://www.tolweb.org/Nymphalini" target="_blank">Nymphalini</a></h3>
<img src="vancar.jpg" width="150" alt="Vanessa cardui" align="right" />
<p>Species in the tribe Nymphalini have been much studied in recent years. The tribe contains many well-known species, such as the red admiral and the painted lady. Temperate species are among the first species seen in Spring since they overwinter as adults. The <a href="http://www.tolweb.org/Nymphalini" target="_blank">phylogenetic relationships</a> of the genera in the tribe are beginning to clear up. <i>Colobura</i> and <i>Tigridia</i> are sister genera and together appear to be sister to the rest of Nymphalini, although in some analyses <i>Smyrna</i> is sister to the two (see <a href="../../publi.htm">Wahlberg 2006</a>). Whether <i>Smyrna</i> is sister to <i>Colobura+Tigridia</i> or to the rest of Nymphalini, both lineages appear to have diverged from the stem Nymphalini in the Paleocene <a href="timing.htm">some 60 to 55 million years ago</a>. The genera <i>Nymphalis, Aglais</i> and <i>Polygonia</i> form a strongly supported and stable clade, known as the <i>Nymphalis</i>-group (<a href="../../publi.htm">Wahlberg and Nylin 2003</a>), with <i>Aglais</i> being sister to the other two. The nomenclature of this group is contentious at the moment, with some people lumping the <a href="Nymphcheck.htm">about 26 species</a> into one genus <i>Nymphalis</i>, and others splitting the group into 8 or more genera. We prefer to retain three genera, although the species <i>Polygonia canace</i> is a difficult case that is sister to the rest of <i>Polygonia</i> only when morphological data is included in the analysis, perhaps justifying it's placement in a separate genus <i>Kaniska</i>. The genera <i>Symbrenthia, Mynes</i> and <i>Araschnia</i> also form a well-supported, stable monophyletic group, although the relationships of the three genera and their respective monophyly are not very clear at the moment (compare Fric et al. 2004 with <a href="../../publi.htm">Wahlberg et al. 2005</a>). The relationships of the <i>Nymphalis</i>-group, <i>Symbrenthia</i>-group, <i>Hypanartia, Antanartia</i> and <i>Vanessa</i> are also still unstable and will require more data to resolve. Whatever the relationships are, it appears that the genera <a href="timing.htm">diverged from each other</a> in the Eocene, between 50-35 million years ago.</p>

<h3><a href="http://www.tolweb.org/Victorinini" target="_blank">Victorinini</a></h3>
<img src="analyt.jpg" width="150" alt="Anartia lytrea" align="right" />
<p>The recently resurrected tribe Victorinini was necessary when it was discovered that the tribe Kallimini of previous authors was paraphyletic with regard to Melitaeini (<a href="../../publi.htm">Wahlberg et al. 2005, Wahlberg 2006</a>). Victorinini comprises the South American genera <i>Metamorpha, Napeocles, Siproeta</i> and <i>Anartia</i>. Relationships of the genera are a bit ambiguous, it appears that <i>Napeocles</i> is within <i>Siproeta</i> and that <i>Metamorpha</i> is either sister to <i>Anartia</i>, or sister to the rest of Victorinini. More data and taxa are clearly needed to resolve this. Relationships within <i><a href="http://www.tolweb.org/Anartia" target="_blank">Anartia</a></i> appear to be clear (Blum et al. 2003). The genera in Victorinini appear to have <a href="timing.htm">diverged from each other</a> in the Eocene about 50-40 million years ago.</p>

<h3><a href="http://www.tolweb.org/Junoniini" target="_blank">Junoniini</a></h3>
<p>Junoniini is another tribe resurrected based on recent results (<a href="../../publi.htm">Wahlberg et al. 2005, Wahlberg 2006</a>). Junoniini is a largely African tribe with some species of <i>Hypolimnas</i> and <i>Junonia</i> making it to Asia and Australia, and a few species of <i>Junonia</i> to the New World. The genus <i>Yoma</i> is entirely restricted to Asia and Australia. Relationships of genera are quite robust with current data. Molecular results brought some surprises for this tribe. First of all, it is clear that <i>Junonia</i> and <i>Precis</i> (two genera that have been used interchangably for a couple of hundred years) are not each others sister groups, but rather <i>Precis</i> is sister to <i>Hypolimnas</i>. <i>Junonia</i> appears to be related to a clade containing the genera <i>Protogoniomorpha</i> and <i>Yoma</i>, with <i>Salamis</i> being sister to these three. The second surprise was that <i>Salamis</i> of many authors was not monophyletic, with species now in <i>Protogoniomorpha</i> being sister to <i>Yoma</i>. Thirdly, the two species in <i>Kamilla</i> are well within <i>Junonia</i> (thus <i>Kamilla</i> has been synonymised with <i>Junonia</i>), and it appears that the the species "<i>Protogoniomorpha</i>" <i>cytora</i> and "<i>P.</i>" <i>temora</i>, belong most likely also in <i>Junonia</i> (<a href="../../publi.htm">Wahlberg et al. 2005</a>). The tribe appears to have begun <a href="timing.htm">diversifying</a> at the end of the Eocene/beginning of the Oligocene.</p>

<h3><a href="http://www.tolweb.org/Kallimini" target="_blank">Kallimini</a></h3>
<p>The reduced Kallimini comprises only 4 genera and 18 species. The relationships of the four genera are robust with current data, <i>Kallima</i> is sister to <i>Catacroptera+Mallika</i>, and <i>Doleschallia</i> is sister to these three. <i>Doleschallia</i> is largely restricted to the Australasian region, with one species coming in to SE Asia. <i>Kallima</i>, well-known for the near perfect leaf mimicking undersides of its wings, is restricted to tropical Asia, while <i>Catacroptera</i> and <i>Mallika</i> (both with single species) are found only in Africa.</p>

<h3><a href="http://www.tolweb.org/Melitaeini" target="_blank">Melitaeini</a></h3>

<img src="meldid.jpg" width="150px" alt="Melitaea didyma" align="right" />

<p>The tribe Melitaeini has been much studied ecologically and recently also phylogenetically (Kons 2000, <a href="../../publi.htm">Wahlberg &amp; Zimmermann 2000, Zimmermann et al. 2000, Wahlberg et al. 2003, 2005, Wahlberg 2006, Wahlberg &amp; Freitas 2007</a>). The tribe has five major clades that could be named subtribes, the <i>Euphydryas</i>-group (Euphydryina), the <i>Chlosyne</i>-group, the <i>Melitaea</i>-group (Melitaeina), the <i>Phyciodes</i>-group (Phyciodina) and the <i>Gnathotriche</i>-group. <i>Euphydryas</i> is the sister group to the rest of Melitaeini with strong support, but the relationships of the other groups is not clear. Currently it looks like the <i>Gnathotriche</i>-group is sister to Phyciodina, with Melitaeina being sister to these two (<a href="../../publi.htm">Wahlberg et al. 2005, Wahlberg 2006, Wahlberg &amp; Freitas 2007</a>). </p>

<h3>Incertae cedis genera</h3>
<p>The relationships of the four species belonging to the genera <i>Kallimoides, Vanessula, Rhinopalpa</i> and <i>Pycina</i> are not clear at the moment. All four have very long branches based on molecular data, causing them to jump around in various analyses. All four are clearly part of Nymphalinae, and the first three appear to belong to the clade comprising Victorinini, Junoniini, Kallimini and Melitaeini, while <i>Pycina</i> is not settling down in any part of the Nymphalinae tree so far. Clearly more data are needed for these ancient taxa.</p>
